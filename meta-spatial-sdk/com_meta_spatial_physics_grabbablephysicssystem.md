# GrabbablePhysicsSystem Class

Extends
[SystemBase](/reference/spatial-sdk/v0.10.1/com_meta_spatial_core_systembase)
*Modifiers:
final*

System that manages physics state changes for grabbable entities. When an entity is grabbed, its physics state is switched to KINEMATIC. When released, the physics state is restored to its original value.

## Signature

```kotlin
class GrabbablePhysicsSystem : SystemBase
```

## Constructors

| **GrabbablePhysicsSystem** () | Signature ```kotlin constructor() ``` Returns [GrabbablePhysicsSystem](/reference/spatial-sdk/v0.10.1/com_meta_spatial_physics_grabbablephysicssystem) |
| --- | --- |

## Properties

| **executeCount** : Long [Get] | The number of times the system has been executed. Signature ```kotlin var executeCount: Long ``` |
| --- | --- |
| **systemManager** : [SystemManager](/reference/spatial-sdk/v0.10.1/com_meta_spatial_core_systemmanager) [Get][Set] | The system manager that this system is associated with. Signature ```kotlin lateinit var systemManager: SystemManager ``` |

## Functions

| **associateSystemManager** ( systemManager ) | Associates this system with a system manager, used in the Spatial SDK. Signature ```kotlin fun associateSystemManager(systemManager: SystemManager) ``` Parameters systemManager: [SystemManager](/reference/spatial-sdk/v0.10.1/com_meta_spatial_core_systemmanager) The system manager to associate with. |
| --- | --- |
| **delete** ( entity ) | System should do any housekeeping based on [SystemBase.delete](/reference/spatial-sdk/v0.10.1/com_meta_spatial_core_systembase#delete) being removed from the scene Signature ```kotlin open fun delete(entity: Entity) ``` Parameters entity: [Entity](/reference/spatial-sdk/v0.10.1/com_meta_spatial_core_entity) |
| **destroy** () | System should clean up any and all resources for shutdown Signature ```kotlin open fun destroy() ``` |
| **enableGrabbablePhysics** ( enabled ) | Enables or disables the grabbable physics behavior. When disabled, the system will not modify physics states when entities are grabbed. Signature ```kotlin fun enableGrabbablePhysics(enabled: Boolean = true) ``` Parameters enabled: Boolean Whether to enable grabbable physics behavior. Defaults to true. |
| **equals** ( other ) | Checks if this system is equal to another object. Signature ```kotlin open operator override fun equals(other: Any?): Boolean ``` Parameters other: Any? The object to compare with. Returns Boolean True if this system is equal to the other object, false otherwise. |
| **execute** () | System should perform all the operations based on relevant entities. Signature ```kotlin open override fun execute() ``` |
| **getDependencies** () | Returns the dependencies of this system. Signature ```kotlin open override fun getDependencies(): SystemDependencies? ``` Returns [SystemDependencies?](/reference/spatial-sdk/v0.10.1/com_meta_spatial_core_systemdependencies) The dependencies of this system, or null if there are no dependencies. |
| **getScene** () | Returns the scene that this system is associated with. Signature ```kotlin fun getScene(): Scene ``` Returns [Scene](/reference/spatial-sdk/v0.10.1/com_meta_spatial_runtime_scene) The scene that this system is associated with. |
| **hashCode** () | Returns the hash code of this system. Signature ```kotlin open override fun hashCode(): Int ``` Returns Int The hash code of this system. |
